# PwshSchoolProject

Has yet to be properly tested and edited. 
Pwsh script made by me to import users from a .csv file straight into ActiveDirectory.  
It is recommended to have the .csv and the script in the same dir.  
Although this is not necessary.  
-  
I didn't really see the reason to make the file user defined, yet.  
Call it unhandy, but I prefer speed over long lines.  
-  
To add:  
Logbook.  
User defined file.  
More comments in regards to me making fun of PowerShell's super weird scripting.
